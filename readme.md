This repository contains the codes I used for sentiment analysis on Twitter livestream data as a part of "Inroduction to Data Science" course on Coursera. All the codes are in Python. As a part of this project, I did the following:

+ Accessed Twitter live stream and captured tweets using the oauth2 library and Twitter REST API.
+ Parsed raw tweets obtained in JavaScript Object Notation.
+ Computed term frequency histogram of the livestream data for calculating tweet sentiments.
+ Queried the raw tweet data for various parameters of interest like hashtags, origin of the tweet and top ten hashtags across the tweet data.
